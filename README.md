# belly-button-challenge


## Background

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize in human navels. 
The dataset reveales that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units or OTUs in the study) were present inmore that 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

1. Use the D3 library to read in `samples.json` from the URL `https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json'. 
2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a drop down menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual. 
   * Use `sample_values` as the values for the bar chart. 
   * Use `otu_ids` as the labels for the bar chart.
   * Use `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.
